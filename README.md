# Hello, World!
A quick "Hello, World" demo of some Go features and syntax

There are a number of steps to this demo, each with their own branch.  The master branch contains the complete code.

Quick note - some of the things demoed are deliberately clunky!  This is to show off certain aspects of Go more easily.

## Step One - init, Flags and Some Basics
In the demo, this step shows some of the basics of Go and some of the cool things you get from free.  We'll also setup the first part of our app.

## Step Two - Multiple return values and error handling - Don't Panic!
This part of the demo covers a couple of Go's features that will seem a bit alien to C# and JavaScript developers.  We'll see how we can return multiple values from functions, how we export functions from packages and how Go deals with error handling.

## Step Three - Types, Structs and Interfaces
We're now venturing into Go's powerful type system.  This is very different to the C# and JavaScript worlds. We'll see how to create a custom type and why we'd want to do that how to define interfaces and how to "implement" them and how to create structs.  We'll also look at dates, because why not.
